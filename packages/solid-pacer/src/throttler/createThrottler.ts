/**
 * A low-level Solid hook that creates a `Throttler` instance that limits how often the provided function can execute.
 *
 * This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
 * you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc). For a simpler and higher-level hook that
 * integrates directly with Solid's createSignal, see createThrottledSignal.
 *
 * Throttling ensures a function executes at most once within a specified time window,
 * regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting
 * expensive operations or UI updates.
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. You can subscribe to state changes
 * in two ways:
 *
 * **1. Using `throttler.Subscribe` component (Recommended for component tree subscriptions)**
 *
 * Use the `Subscribe` component to subscribe to state changes deep in your component tree without
 * needing to pass a selector to the hook. This is ideal when you want to subscribe to state
 * in child components.
 *
 * **2. Using the `selector` parameter (For hook-level subscriptions)**
 *
 * The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which state changes will trigger reactive updates
 * at the hook level, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary updates when irrelevant
 * state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function or using the `Subscribe` component. This prevents unnecessary
 * updates and gives you full control over when your component tracks state changes.
 *
 * Available state properties:
 * - `canLeadingExecute`: Whether the throttler can execute on the leading edge
 * - `canTrailingExecute`: Whether the throttler can execute on the trailing edge
 * - `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
 * - `isPending`: Whether the throttler is waiting for the timeout to trigger execution
 * - `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
 * - `lastExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the last execution
 * - `nextExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the next allowed execution
 * - `status`: Current execution status ('disabled' | 'idle' | 'pending')
 *
 * ## Unmount behavior
 *
 * By default, the primitive cancels any pending execution when the owning component unmounts.
 * Use the `onUnmount` option to customize this. For example, to flush pending work instead:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const throttler = createThrottler(fn, {
 *   wait: 1000,
 *   onUnmount: (t) => t.flush()
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const throttler = createThrottler(setValue, { wait: 1000 });
 *
 * // Subscribe to state changes deep in component tree using Subscribe component
 * <throttler.Subscribe selector={(state) => ({ isPending: state.isPending })}>
 *   {(state) => (
 *     <div>{state().isPending ? 'Loading...' : 'Ready'}</div>
 *   )}
 * </throttler.Subscribe>
 *
 * // Opt-in to track isPending changes at hook level (optimized for loading states)
 * const throttler = createThrottler(
 *   setValue,
 *   { wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({ isPending: state.isPending })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to track executionCount changes (optimized for tracking execution)
 * const throttler = createThrottler(
 *   setValue,
 *   { wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({ executionCount: state.executionCount })
 * );
 *
 * // Multiple state properties - track when any of these change
 * const throttler = createThrottler(
 *   setValue,
 *   {
 *     wait: 2000,
 *     leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
 *     trailing: false  // Skip trailing edge updates
 *   },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     isPending: state.isPending,
 *     executionCount: state.executionCount,
 *     lastExecutionTime: state.lastExecutionTime,
 *     nextExecutionTime: state.nextExecutionTime
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
 * const { isPending, executionCount } = throttler.state();
 * ```
