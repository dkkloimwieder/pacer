/**
 * A Solid hook that creates a throttled state value that updates at most once within a specified time window.
 * This hook combines Solid's createSignal with throttling functionality to provide controlled state updates.
 *
 * Throttling ensures state updates occur at a controlled rate regardless of how frequently the setter is called.
 * This is useful for rate-limiting expensive updates or operations that depend on rapidly changing state.
 *
 * The hook returns a tuple containing:
 * - The throttled state value accessor
 * - A throttled setter function that respects the configured wait time
 * - The throttler instance for additional control
 *
 * For more direct control over throttling without state management,
 * consider using the lower-level createThrottler hook instead.
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management via the underlying throttler instance.
 * The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which throttler state changes will trigger reactive updates,
 * optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary subscriptions when irrelevant state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary reactive updates and gives you
 * full control over when your component subscribes to state changes. Only when you provide a selector will
 * the reactive system track the selected state values.
 *
 * Available throttler state properties:
 * - `canLeadingExecute`: Whether the throttler can execute on the leading edge
 * - `canTrailingExecute`: Whether the throttler can execute on the trailing edge
 * - `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
 * - `isPending`: Whether the throttler is waiting for the timeout to trigger trailing execution
 * - `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
 * - `lastExecutionTime`: Unix timestamp of the last execution
 * - `nextExecutionTime`: Unix timestamp of the next allowed execution
 * - `status`: Current execution status ('disabled' | 'idle' | 'pending')
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const [value, setValue, throttler] = createThrottledSignal(0, { wait: 1000 });
 *
 * // Opt-in to reactive updates when pending state changes (optimized for loading indicators)
 * const [value, setValue, throttler] = createThrottledSignal(
 *   0,
 *   { wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({ isPending: state.isPending })
 * );
 *
 * // With custom leading/trailing behavior
 * const [value, setValue] = createThrottledSignal(0, {
 *   wait: 1000,
 *   leading: true,   // Update immediately on first change
 *   trailing: false  // Skip trailing edge updates
 * });
 *
 * // Access throttler state via signals
 * console.log('Executions:', throttler.state().executionCount);
 * console.log('Is pending:', throttler.state().isPending);
 * console.log('Last execution:', throttler.state().lastExecutionTime);
 * console.log('Next execution:', throttler.state().nextExecutionTime);
 * ```
